# sshtools

## What is it?

My first _Go_ CLI tool :|

This is mostly a practice tool, built using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
It's supposed to help with configuration for `ssh`, such as deleting a specific line from the `known_hosts` file etc.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/amitizle/sshtools
```

## Testing
